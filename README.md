 Assignment 4 - Hacking System

The objective of the game is to guess the password and enter it into the system without typing it. The password is case sensitive, so make sure to enter the right one.

- There are 3 types of difficulty: Easy, Normal and Hard
- Case sensitive password is triggered with a hint
- There are falling letters which have character masking if in NORMAL or HARD mode.
- In EASY mode there is no character masking
- Use Arrow Keys/WASD to guide the Cursor to the appropriate location
- Press Enter/Return Key to select the letter that the Cursor hovers on
- Press Backspace button or Click on the OnScreen Backspace button to remove a letter
- The “Operator_” on the right down corner is a feedback UI that will help you be on track if you enter a wrong character or wrong cased letter
- When done with the password, Click the OnScreen Send button
- Correct password will trigger a win state, wrong password triggers a lose state
- Running out of timer also triggers a lose state
